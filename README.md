Yincart PHP Framework Version 2
===========================

Thank you for choosing Yincart 2 - a modern PHP framework designed for professional Web development.

Yincart 2 is a complete rewrite of its previous version Yincart 1.1 which is one of the most popular PHP frameworks.
Yincart 2 inherits the main spirit behind Yincart for being simple, fast and highly extensible.
Yincart 2 requires PHP 5.4 and embraces the best practices and protocols found in modern Web application development.


**Yincart 2 is not ready for production use yet.** We may make significant changes without prior notices.
We expect to make the first stable release of Yincart 2 in the end of 2014.

If you mainly want to learn Yincart with no real project development requirement, we highly recommend
you start with Yincart 2 as it will be our main focus for the next few years.

If you have a real project with tight schedule, you should stick to [Yincart 1](https://github.com/yincart/basic)
which is the latest stable release of Yincart.
