Yincart E-Commerce Framework Version 2
===========================

Thank you for choosing Yincart 2 - a modern e-commerce framework designed for professional Web development.

Yincart 2 is a complete rewrite of its previous version Yincart 1.1 which is one of the most popular e-commerce frameworks.
Yincart 2 inherits the main spirit behind Yincart for being simple, fast and highly extensible.
Yincart 2 requires PHP 5.4 and embraces the best practices and protocols found in modern Web application development.


**Yincart 2 is not ready for production use yet.** We may make significant changes without prior notices.
We expect to make the first stable release of Yincart 2 in the end of 2014.

If you mainly want to learn Yincart with no real project development requirement, we highly recommend
you start with Yincart 2 as it will be our main focus for the next few years.

If you have a real project with tight schedule, you should stick to [Yincart 1](https://github.com/yincart/basic)
which is the latest stable release of Yincart.

HOW TO PARTICIPATE
------------------

Yincart2的设计理念：我们将yincart2打造成一个商城系统的类库，其中包含商城的逻辑，部分控制器和视图主题。
用户只需要用composer(composer的知识内容请自行百度谷歌)引入yincart2framework代码，并在index.php中加载yincart2的前(后台)配置
一个拥有基本功能的商城系统就可以运行了
二次开发：我们的建议是不修改Yincart2的源代码，使用继承重写的方式实现自己的功能。
Yii2的controllerMap是实现了路由与控制器的映射，如果需要修改yincart2的控制器，

**Your participation to Yincart 2 development is very welcome!**
